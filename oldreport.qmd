This report includes the one-year recidivism rates for evidence-based programming provided in the Gotham Department of Corrections facilities for high-risk people. Staffing numbers describe how many full-time employees are needed over the course of a year to keep each program running. Each program facilitator completes extensive training and must complete eight hours of continuing education each year.
