# Virtual Academy Case Study
This GitHub repository contains materials for the Advancing Data in Corrections (ADC) Virtual Academy conference (08/16/2024 - 08/17/2024). Specifically, code and guidance for the Case Study.

## Project overview  
The Virtual Academy for Corrections Analysts program, or VA, will set standards for and improve corrections departmentsâ€™ analytical capacity in order to enable more informed planning and decision-making at the agency and state levels.

OBJECTIVES:
  - Establish standards for DOC data analyst positions (Identify the core competencies for corrections data analysis and how to use the analysis results.)
  - Train agency analysts and their leadership to meet core competencies.
  - Develop trainings, resources, and communities of practice (CoPs) to implement standards.

## Data  
All data are simulated and created using various statistical sampling packages in R. 

## QMD rendering Guidance

A final Quarto HTML can be rendered (or output) by running the `va_cs.qmd` program in your R statistical software. This may be successfully done by either running `quarto_render("va_cs.qmd")` in your console with the `quarto` library actively loaded in R, or by simply using the `Render` button in R Studio.  

In order to utilize this report with new data in the same format, open the `execute.R` program and follow the parameter guidance. Once changed and saved, `va_cs.qmd` can be rendered again with new output.  
  
The following are important to note:  

1. The datasets required for this case study, `roster.csv`, `rosterupdate.csv`, `staff.csv`, and `staffupdate.csv` are available in this repo. However, they are not necessary to render the final output here as `va_cs.qmd` creates these simulated data.
2. All included .R, .Rmd, and .qmd scripts in this top-level repo are necessary to successfully render output. This is due to various .R programs that are included across .qmd and .Rmd programs developed for quality assurance and efficiency purposes.
3. Rendering `va_cs.qmd` will also create a PDF and DOCX documents called `finaltable.pdf` and `finaltable.docx` respectively containing output for the case study.
